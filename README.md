# Discord.py Role Bot
This bot was designed to auto-assign roles to users in a discord server.

The requirements for the bot were:
- Every user must not exceed 3 bias roles.
- Each user can only have maximum 1 primary bias role and 2 secondary bias roles.
- There are also miscellaneous roles such as vlive which do not count to the maximum role limit.
